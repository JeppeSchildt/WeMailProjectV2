# Foobar
When uploading to code repositories, the folder 
```
\WeMailProjectV2\Email\Users
```
Must not be empty due to the folder storage conventions. 
Ergo, do not delete this file. 

# Deleting Users
If choosing to delete users, delete the folder associated with the user, but remember to also delete the entry in UserName.txt, or the program will return segmentation fault!
